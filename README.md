# GlobalDemographics

This repository contains files pertaining to a report using global demographic data. It uses the CIA factbook visualizing global population data through k-means clustering techniques. Check out the corresponding R Shiny App at https://abbank92.shinyapps.io/USPopMap/. Please read the PDF markdown report for a full explaination of the algorithm, its performance, and various extensions.

You can find the data used and the code in the `ProjectCode` folder as well as other less-organized notes and bits of code.
